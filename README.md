* NOTE: all CRUD operations are working, but in this video I only tried the update..

## W08D04 CRUD Express App with Mongoose & React Native

* Create an express app for library what we made it yesterday.
* Make a connection for mongoose and express app.
* Make routes folder, and create 2 files:
    1. author route.
    2. book route.
* endpoints:
    * Write CRUD for authors and books.
    * Write an endpoint that: show more details about specific author.

* Test it in postman.

* Connect backend with frontend, and in frontend:
    1. The user can make all CRUD operations.
    2. When user click on any of authors images, show more details about them.
